# Dotfiles and configurations

With this repo I want to track the configurations for the tools I find essential to have on every system.

Eventually the aim is to solve some intrinsic issues as well:
- **Replication**: how to effortlessly replicate the configurations on a new system?
- **Consistency**: how to make sure changes are consistent and repeatable?
- **Dependency management**: how to avoid implicit dependencies?

Let me introduce what are these tools and how I find convenient to use them.
