# Dotfiles and configurations

With this repo I want to track the configurations for the tools I find
essential to have on every system.

Eventually the aim is to solve some intrinsic issues as well:

- **Replication**: how to effortlessly replicate the configurations on
                   a new system?
- **Consistency**: how to make sure changes are consistent and repeatable?
- **Dependency management**: how to avoid implicit dependencies?

## Tools

**[vim](vim-bare/INSTALL.md)**: must have editor
**[rust-tools](rust-tools/INSTALL.md)**: rust community has rewritten a set
    of linux standard tools... with a modern twist
**[fish](fish/INSTALL.md)**: a modern shell with nice defaults
**[github-tools](github-tools/INSTALL.md)**: some tools are better to be
    installed from github repository (or it's the only way)
