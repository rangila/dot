# Dot

My dotfiles for:

- terminal emulator life
- developing rather big projects: mostly C++, works almost as well with stuff
  like Scala or Python if you can live with some limitations.

## Key features

Here are my debatable choices:

- use terminal everywhere
- use fish, forget about POSIX-compatible unless you have to do serious
  scripting
- use fuzzy matching everywhere
- use vim with a minimal configuration, drown nvim with plugins
- use a consistent color-scheme
- use ctags for code completion navigation
- do not automatize the installation process - I'm simply not ready to
  maintain it
